2048 Game using Tkinter
🎯 Overview

This is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) version of the classic 2048 puzzle game, built entirely using Python and Tkinter.
The player combines numbered tiles to reach the 2048 tile. The game automatically updates the board and score after every move.

⚙️ Features

🕹️ Smooth Gameplay with arrow key controls (Up, Down, Left, Right)

🎨 Modern GUI Design using Tkinter labels and color-coded tiles

💯 Real-time Score Update displayed dynamically

🔁 Automatic Tile Generation after each valid move

🔢 Color Mapping for each tile value (2 → 2048)

🧠 Core Game Logic includes tile compression, merging, and board updates

🧠 Game Logic

The game uses:

Compression: Shifts all numbers left to remove gaps

Merging: Combines equal adjacent tiles (adds score)

Random Tile Generation: Adds new tiles (2 or 4) after each valid move

Matrix Transposition: Handles up/down moves by rotating the grid

🖥️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

Save the file as 2048_game_tkinter.py

Run the game:

python 2048_game_tkinter.py


Use your arrow keys to move tiles and combine numbers!

🧩 Requirements

No external dependencies required — Tkinter is included in Python by default.
